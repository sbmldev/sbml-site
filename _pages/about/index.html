Prior to this, I worked in banking and auditing - it’s also where my first degree was. I made the switch because I found AI and machine learning too fascinating to ignore, and I wanted to work on things that spark genuine curiosity.</p> <p>I’m especially drawn to the kind of tech that feels close to building - web development, cloud tools, and of course, anything that lets me experiment. This site is part of that: a space to keep track of what I’m learning, try things out, and occasionally share things I wish someone had told me earlier.</p> </body></html>
