Hi, I'm Suresh Balasubramanian. I'm an undergrad at IIT Madras, currently pursuing a degree in Data Science.

Before stepping into the world of machine learning, I was in the audit and banking field. Over time, I felt the need for a change - something that involved more learning, creativity, and challenge. AI checked all those boxes, and I’ve been drawn to it ever since.

I'm currently exploring the tools, technologies, and research directions that make up the world of Machine Learning and MLOps. Along the way, I’ve also been learning full-stack development and cloud computing - skills I believe are essential for building and deploying real-world AI systems.

While I’m still building my foundation, what fascinates me most is the ability to find patterns in data and use them to make meaningful decisions - a direction I hope to explore further through research and its real-world applications.

This site is where I share what I’m learning - the things I wish someone had told me, the stuff I figured out the hard way, my projects, and my thoughts on topics in this space.

Thank you for stopping by.
