I'm an undergrad at IIT Madras, currently pursuing degree in data science and machine learning.

Before stepping into the world of machine learning, I was in the audit and banking field. Over time, I felt the need for a change - something that involved more learning, creativity, and challenge. AI checked all those boxes, and I’ve been drawn to it ever since.

I'm currently exploring the tools, technologies, and research directions that make up the world of machine learning and MLOps. I also find the latest developments in the web technologies fascinating, and have been learning full-stack development (as a hobby for the most part) and cloud computing.

This site is where I share what I’m learning - the things I wish someone had told me, the stuff I figured out the hard way, my projects, and my thoughts on topics in this space.

Thank you for stopping by.
