I’m a second-year undergraduate student with a deep interest in **machine learning**, **statistics**, and **artificial intelligence**. My background is in business and accounting, but I’m actively building a strong technical foundation across data science/machine learning, programming, and full-stack development.

This site serves as a personal knowledge base, learning journal, and a space to share projects, notes, and ideas — especially in areas like:
- Linear Algebra, Probability, and Statistical Inference
- Optimization and Algorithms
- Full-stack web development and self-hosted infrastructure
- ML and MLOps

I’m currently:
- Working on certification programs in cloud computing and machine learning (AWS, Google Cloud)
- Exploring research opportunities in ML, especially applied projects that combine systems thinking with real-world impact
